  Hi, my name's Rachael and I am experienced in statistics, business analytics and machine learning.  I love to dream big and am very self driven.  I see challenges as opportunities and I have a track record of going above and beyond to accomplish a goal and leading a team along the way.  
 
  Prior to studying Data Science, I founded a charter school and served as a Board Vice Chairman for 10 years gaining teamwork and leadership skills. 
  As a board member, I valued access to transparent and accurate data to make good decisions, I understand how blind you can feel as a decision maker when you don't have access to good data.  
  
  I am passionate about understanding my client's challenges and finding the story within the data that can drive businesses to make informed decisions.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>R</mark> and <mark>Python</mark>.  I love math, programming & problem solving. 
  
  I also am skilled at <mark>SQL</mark>, <mark>Machine Learning</mark>, <mark>Excel</mark>, <mark>Power BI</mark>, <mark>R</mark>, & <mark>Tableau</mark>.
