  Hi, my name's Rachael, I am experienced in statistics, business analytics & machine learning.  I love to dream big & am very self driven.  I see challenges as opportunities & have a track record of going above and beyond to accomplish a goal while leading a team along the way.  
 
  Prior to studying Data Science, I founded a leadership charter school & served as Board Vice Chairman for 11 years gaining teamwork & leadership skills. 
  As a board member I valued access to transparent & accurate data to make good decisions, & I understand how blind decision makers can feel when they don't have access to good data.  
  
  I am passionate about understanding my client's challenges & finding the story within the data that can drive businesses to make informed decisions.
  I am most skilled in: <mark>R</mark> & <mark>Python</mark>.  I love math, programming & problem solving. 
  
  I also am skilled at <mark>SQL</mark>, <mark>Machine Learning</mark>, <mark>Google Cloud Platform</mark>, <mark>Excel</mark>, <mark>Power BI</mark>, & <mark>Tableau</mark>.
  Ask me about wake surfing, baking, building furniture, or remodeling.

      - Raising 5 children is teaching me the value of different perspectives, patience, consistency, and having a higher purpose
      - Founding a charter school is like starting any business, and taught me the value of grit & that it is possible to make big things happen, against all odds, when you have a clear vision & the right team by your side
      - Serving on a school board taught me leadership and presentation skills, the importance integrity in teams, the value of using good, accurate data, data-driven decision making, and the importance of a unified vision 
      - Going back to college has shown me that it is never too late to pursue your dreams, & it just as valuable to ask questions as to answer them
      <br>
      <br>*My whole life I have loved solving problems of all kinds, whether it's math problems, building furniture, baking, or helping businesses find ways to use their data or measure their mission and vision, I am all in! I am always looking to connect with clients who feel I can add value to their business.*
